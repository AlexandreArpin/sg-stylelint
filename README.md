git clone https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-stylelint.git
```

### Release

**Process**

Updates of this configuration package should batch multiple changes. Most of stylelint rules are stylistics and doesn't have an impact on the success of a project. On the other hand, frequent changes of those rules might cause friction and be a burden for the teams.

Adding a new rule or updating an existing one can generate a lot of modifications to the code of an existing project. To ensure that the authors of the projects who consume those configuration packages understand the impact of updating a package, every release of a package **should be a major increment to the version number**.

Every release should also contain a **release notes** that includes the new or updated rules and how to disabled / revert them manually in the consumer project when possible.

**Do the actual release**

Before you release, make sure you have **write access** for all the NPM packages that will be published and that you are [logged in to NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/logging-in-to-an-npm-enterprise-registry-from-the-command-line).

To release, open a terminal at the root project of the workspace and execute the following:

```bash
yarn release
```
